# Authorization

Dwolla utilizes the [OAuth 2 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to facilitate authorization. OAuth is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain access to protected resources (Transfers, Funding Sources, Customers etc.) in the Dwolla API. This section covers application auth which is meant for server-to-server applications using the Dwolla API.

#### Creating an application
Before you can get started with making OAuth requests, youâ€™ll need to first register an application with Dwolla by logging in and navigating to the applications page. Once an application is registered you will obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret` (aka App Key and Secret), which will be used to identify your application when calling the Dwolla API. The Sandbox environment provides you with a created application once you have signed up for an account. Learn more in our [getting started guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/sandbox-setup/). **Remember:** Your client_secret should be kept a secret! Be sure to store your client credentials securely.

#### Token lifetime

**Access tokens** are *short lived*: 1 hour. To refresh authorization on an application access token, your application will simply exchange its client credentials for a new app access token which will invalidate the previous token.

## Application authorization

The [client credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) is used when an application needs to obtain permission to act on its own behalf. To obtain an application access token, your application will send a POST requests with the Authorization header that contains the word `Basic` followed by a space and a base64-encoded string client_id:client_secret. An application access token can then be used to make calls to the Dwolla API on behalf of the application, for example, create a webhook subscription, retrieve events, and make calls to [Customer](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#customers) related endpoints.

`Authorization: Basic Base64(client_id:client_secret)`

#### HTTP request

**Production:** `POST https://accounts.dwolla.com/token`

**Sandbox:** `POST https://accounts-sandbox.dwolla.com/token`

Including the `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header, the request is sent to the token endpoint with `grant_type=client_credentials` in the body of the request:

#### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| client_id | yes | string | Application key. Navigate to `https://www.dwolla.com/applications` (production) or `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications` (Sandbox) for your application key. |
| client_secret | yes | string | Application secret. Navigate to `https://www.dwolla.com/applications` (production) or `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications` (Sandbox) for your application secret. |
| grant_type | yes | string | This must be set to `client_credentials`. |

#### Response parameters

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
access_token | A new access token that is used to authenticate against resources that belong to the app itself.
expires_in | The lifetime of the access token, in seconds.  Default is 3600.
token_type | Always `bearer`.

### HTTP status and error codes
| HTTP Status | Message | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | OK | Valid request. |
| 400 | invalid_request | Malformed request. |
