# Authorization

Dwolla utilizes the [OAuth 2 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to facilitate authorization. OAuth is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain access to protected resources (Transfers, Funding Sources, Customers etc.) in the Dwolla API. Access to the Dwolla API can be granted to an application either on behalf of a user or on behalf of the application itself. This section covers application auth which is meant for server-to-server applications using the Access API.  

#### Creating an application
Before you can get started with making OAuth requests, you’ll need to first register an application with Dwolla by logging in and navigating to the applications page. Once an application is registered you will obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret` (aka App Key and Secret), which will be used to identify your application when calling the Dwolla API. The Sandbox environment provides you with a created application once you have signed up for an account. Learn more in our [getting started guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/sandbox-setup/). **Remember:** Your client_secret should be kept a secret! Be sure to store your client credentials securely.

#### Token lifetime

**Access tokens** are *short lived*: 1 hour. To refresh authorization on an application access token, your application will simply exchange its client credentials for a new app access token which will invalidate the previous token.

## Application authorization

The [client credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) is used when an application needs to obtain permission to act on its own behalf. An application will exchange it's `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `grant_type=client_credentials` for an application access token. An application access token can then be used to make calls to the Dwolla API on behalf of the application, for example, create a webhook subscription, retrieve events, and make calls to Access API Customer related endpoints. The primary reason for obtaining an application access token is for managing webhooks and events. However, Dwolla has modified this grant type by allowing applications to access Access API [Customer](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#customers) related endpoints using the application access token.

#### HTTP request

**Production:** `POST https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token`

**Sandbox:** `POST https://sandbox.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token`

Including the `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header, the request is sent to the token endpoint with the following `form-encoded` parameters:

#### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| client_id | yes | string | Application key. Navigate to `https://www.dwolla.com/applications` (production) or `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications` (Sandbox) for your application key. |
| client_secret | yes | string | Application secret. Navigate to `https://www.dwolla.com/applications` (production) or `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications` (Sandbox) for your application secret. |
| grant_type | yes | string | This must be set to `client_credentials`. |

#### Response parameters

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
access_token | A new access token that is used to authenticate against resources that belong to the app itself.
expires_in | The lifetime of the access token, in seconds.  Default is 3600.
token_type | Always `bearer`.
