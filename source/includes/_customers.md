# Customers

A Customer represents an individual or business with whom you intend to transact with and is programmatically created and managed by a Dwolla [account](#accounts) via the API. In order for a Dwolla `Account` to create and manage Customers, an application must obtain permission from Dwolla before being enabled in production.

<ol class="alerts">
    <li class="alert icon-alert-info">This section outlines functionality for [the Dwolla API](https://www.dwolla.com/platform), a premium product that only approved partners may access in production. To learn more about entering into a Dwolla API agreement, please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs).</li>

### Customer types

With a transfer of money, at least one party must complete the identity verification process, either the sender or the receiver. It’s your decision about which party completes this process, based on your business model, and you may want to have both parties complete the identity verification process. In cases where a Customer is sending funds to or receiving funds from your account, the Customer can remain unverified because your account is already verified. However, if you need to transfer funds between your Customers, at least one of them will need to be verified.

Receive-only customers are restricted to a "payouts only" business model. A receive-only customer maintains limited functionality in the API and is only eligible to receive transfers to an attached bank account from the Dwolla `Account` that created it.

For a more in-depth look at Dwolla API Customer types, reference the [Customer types](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/account-types/access-api-accounts.html) resource article.

### Migrating Dwolla user Accounts to Dwolla API Customers

Dwolla offers a seamless process for migrating existing user [Accounts](#accounts) managed via OAuth on your platform to Dwolla API [Customers](#customers). The user Account will maintain existing functionality on dwolla.com and will act as a separate Dwolla API Customer upon completion of the migration. To learn more about upgrading to the Dwolla API, please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs).

If the additional attempt fails, the resulting status will be either `document` or `suspended`. |
| document | Verified Customers of type `personal` or `business` can have this status. Dwolla requires additional documentation to identify the Customer in the `document` status.  Read about [Documents](#documents). |

| suspended | All Customer types can have a status of `suspended`. The Customer is suspended and may neither send nor receive funds. Contact Dwolla support for more information. |

## Update a customer

This endpoint can be used to facilitate the following use cases: Update Customer information, upgrade an `unverified` Customer to a `verified` Customer, suspend a Customer, deactivate a Customer, reactivate a Customer, and update a verified Customer's information to `retry` verification.

### HTTP request
`POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}`

### Update a Customer's information
A limited set of information can be updated on an existing created Customer. **Note:** A Customer's information cannot be updated when in a [status](#customer-statuses) of `document` or `suspended`.

##### Request parameters -  unverified Customer and receive-only Customer
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| firstName | no | string | Customer's first name. |
| lastName | no | string | Customer's last name. |
| email | no | string | Customer's email address. |
| businessName | no | string | Customer's registered business name. An empty string value will unset businessName. |

##### Request parameters -  verified Customer
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| email | no | string | Customer's email address. |
| ipAddress | no | string | Customer's IP address. |
| address1 | no | string | First line of the street address of the customer's permanent residence. **Note:** PO Boxes are not allowed. |
| address2 | no | string | Second line of the street address of the customer's permanent residence. **Note:** PO Boxes are not allowed. |
| city | no | string | City of customer's permanent residence. |
| state | no | string | Two letter abbreviation of the state in which the customer resides.  e.g. `NY`. |
| postalCode | no | string | Postal code of customer's permanent residence. Should be a five digit postal code, e.g. `50314`. |
| phone | no | string | Customer's 10 digit phone number.  No hyphens or other separators, e.g. `3334447777`. |

##### Request parameters - verified Customer with type=business
In addition to the table above, business verified Customers can update the following fields.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| doingBusinessAs | no | string | Name that is different from the officially registered name of Customer’s business. |
| website | no | string | www.domain.com |

### Upgrade an unverified Customer to verified Customer
An unverified Customer can be upgraded to a verified Customer by supplying the necessary information required to create a verified Customer. Reference [this table](#request-parameters---verified-customer) for required information.

### Suspend a Customer
Unverified and Verified Customers can be suspended by specifying a status of `suspended` in your request. You'll need to contact Dwolla to unsuspend a Customer.

##### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| status | yes | string | Value of `suspended`. |

### Deactivate a Customer
Customers can be deactivated by specifying a status of `deactivated` in your request. A Customer **cannot** be deactivated if the Customer has a `suspended` verification status. Customers can be systematically deactivated by Dwolla if certain ACH return codes are triggered on bank transfer failures.

##### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| status | yes | string | Value of `deactivated`. |

### Reactivate a Customer
Customers can be reactivated by specifying a status of `reactivated` in your request. Reactivated Customers will be moved to the status they were in prior to being deactivated.

##### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| status | yes | string | Value of `reactivated`. |

### Retry verification
If the verified Customer has a status of `retry`, some information may have been miskeyed. You have one more opportunity to correct any mistakes using this endpoint. This time, you’ll need to provide the Customer’s full SSN. If the additional attempt fails, the resulting status will be either `document` or `suspended`.

### Customer must be in the retry state:

## Create an on-demand transfer authorization

This section outlines how to create an on-demand bank transfer authorization for your Customer. On-demand authorization allows Customers to authorize Dwolla to transfer variable amounts from their bank account using ACH at a later point in time for products or services delivered. This on-demand authorization is supplied along with the Customer's bank details when creating a [new Customer funding source](#new-funding-source-for-a-customer).

When on-demand authorization is enabled for your application the Customer is presented with text on a “add bank account” screen in your user interface(UI) giving authorization to Dwolla for future variable payments. **Note:** On-demand payments come as part of our Dwolla API and requires additional approval before getting started. Please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) for more information on enabling.

### HTTP request
`POST https://api.dwolla.com/on-demand-authorizations`

## Create a funding source for a customer
There are two methods available for adding a bank or credit union account to a Customer. You can either collect the Customer's bank account information and pass it to Dwolla via the [new Customer funding source](#new-funding-source-for-a-customer) endpoint, or you can send the Customer through the the [Instant Account Verification](#instant-account-verification-iav) (IAV) flow which will add and verify a bank account within seconds.

Before a Dwolla account or Dwolla API Customer is eligible to transfer money from their bank or credit union account they need to verify ownership of the account, either via Instant Account Verification (IAV) or micro-deposits. For more information on bank account verification, reference this [funding source verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/funding-source-verification.html) resource article.

### New funding source for a customer
Create a new Funding Source for a Customer.  Customers can have a maximum of 6 funding sources.

### HTTP request
`POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/funding-sources`

### Request parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| _links | no | object | A <code>_links</code> JSON object containing an `on-demand-authorization` link relation. See example raw request and response below. |
| routingNumber | yes | string | The bank account's routing number. |
| accountNumber | yes | string | The bank account number. |
| bankAccountType | yes | string | Type of bank account: `checking` or `savings`. |
| name | yes | string | Arbitrary nickname for the funding source. Must be 50 characters or less. |
| channels | no | array | An array containing a list of processing channels.  ACH is the default processing channel for bank transfers. Acceptable value for channels is: "wire". e.g. `“channels”: [ “wire” ]`. A funding source (Bank Account) added using the wire channel only supports a funds transfer going to the bank account from a balance. As a result, wire as a destination funding source can only be added where the Customer account type is a Verified Customer. **Note:** `channels` is a premium feature that must be enabled on your account and is only available to select [Dwolla API](https://www.dwolla.com/platform) partners. |

### HTTP status and error codes
| HTTP Status | Code | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 400 | ValidationError | Can be: Duplicate funding source or validation error. Authorization already associated to a funding source. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Not authorized to create funding source. |

### Instant account verification (IAV)
IAV is a simple and secure process which requires both server-side and client-side interaction. Your server requests a [single-use token](#generate-an-iav-token) which is used to represent the Customer that is adding or verifying their bank. The client-side implementation includes the dwolla.js library on the page that is used to render the IAV flow.

```javascriptnoselect
<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var iavToken = '4adF858jPeQ9RnojMHdqSD2KwsvmhO7Ti7cI5woOiBGCpH5krY';
  dwolla.configure('sandbox');
  dwolla.iav.start(iavToken, {
  container: 'iavContainer',
  stylesheets: [
    'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&subset=latin,latin-ext',
    'https://myapp.com/iav/customStylesheet.css'
  ],
  microDeposits: false,
  fallbackToMicroDeposits: true,
  backButton: true,
  subscriber: ({ currentPage, error }) => {
      console.log('currentPage:', currentPage, 'error:', JSON.stringify(error))
    }
  }, function(err, res) {
    console.log('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(err) + ' -- Response: ' + JSON.stringify(res))
  });
</script>
```

### Initiate IAV flow

Initiate instant account verification for a Customer.

#### dwolla.js
`dwolla.js` is a JavaScript library that gives you the ability to render the IAV flow within a specified container. Call the function `dwolla.iav.start()` and pass the following arguments: the container where you want IAV to render, the Customer's single-use [IAV token](#generate-an-iav-token), and a callback to handle the `response` or `error`. This will initiate an HTTP request asking Dwolla to load IAV in the specified container. Once the Customer successfully completes the IAV flow, Dwolla sends a response that includes either an error or a link to the newly created and verified funding source resource.

#### Usage and configuration

##### Include dwolla.js

**Development version:**
`<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>`

**Production (minified) version:**
`<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.min.js"></script>`
